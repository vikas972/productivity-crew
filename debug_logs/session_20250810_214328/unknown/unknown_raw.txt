This report indicates that fundamental issues arise due to a complete lack of generated data across all relevant entities. Each category of validation suffers from insufficient entries that would allow for a quality assurance audit to occur. Critical errors suggest immediate remediation actions, particularly focusing on generating baseline data to fulfill referential integrity requirements as well as business rules for proper validation.
